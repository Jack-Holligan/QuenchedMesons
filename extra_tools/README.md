This directory contains additional tools
that were used at various points during the preparation of the data and analysis code release.

- `scrape-continuum.py` and `scrape_fit_correlation_function.py`
  were used to extract metadata from Mathematica notebooks.
  These metadata were later adjusted by hand.
  They should not be needed,
  but are included for information.
- `check_licenses.wls` and `install_matex.wls`
  are helper tools to prepare for running the main analysis workflow.
  These are referred to in the main README.md.
